# Introduction to Human-Centered Security

## Security and Human Behavior

### Information Security

1. Digital security
	- e.g. files, web access to servers
2. Physical security
	- e.g. printing files, storage mediums
	- server may be in access-controlled location

### Security of Information

- Need to know where *information* is to design protection for it.
- If physical access guarded, is locking computer screen required?
	- If only thinking about security, yes.
	- Yes:
		- If more concerned about threats inside the building.
	- No:
		- If more concerned about outside threats â€“ and consider entrance security sufficient.
- Can screen-locking + entry security + ...(other security measures) be implemented?
	- Yes, but assumes *unlimited* resources and options (budget).
	- Does not take into account what purpose computers are used for and what work people are doing in the offices.
- Security must be considered with respect to its *context*.
	- E.g. person is 'in transit' between 'home' <-> 'work'.
- Role of security must be considered part of **human behavior**.
	- Often neglected in design of secure systems.

### Availability

- Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA).
- Availability:
	> Property of a system resource being usable upon demand.
- If availability is considered a requirement, an unusable system cannot be secure.
- Security mindset: consider how things can be made to fail.
